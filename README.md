# BMI Calculator

This is a web page that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. Users can input their weight and height in either metric units (kilograms and centimeters) or US units (pounds and feet/inches). The BMI value and corresponding category (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese) are displayed in real-time as the user inputs the values.

## Technologies Used

## Features
